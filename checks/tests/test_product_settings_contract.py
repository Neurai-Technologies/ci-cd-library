"""product.settings.example and the files in deploy/ name the same settings, in both directions.

A script that requires a key the example does not list fails on first use in
every product that copied the example; one that reads an optional key the
example does not list has a setting nobody can find; a key in the example
that nothing reads does nothing while looking as if it did.

Scanned: every deploy/**/*.sh, every Dockerfile under deploy/,
deploy/compose.example.yml, deploy/restore-drill/docker-compose.yml,
deploy/deployer/ci-gate.jq and deploy/vm/launchagent.plist.template.
Required means `${KEY:?...}` or `${KEY?...}`, which covers every `: "${KEY:?`
line; optional means `${KEY:-...}` or `${KEY-...}`; read means `$KEY` or
`${KEY` anywhere in a scanned file.
