"""The login agent's lock must not outlive the run that took it.

vm-autostart.sh holds a flock on descriptor 9 for its whole run, so two
starters never race. colima start leaves daemons behind, and a child inherits
every open descriptor: a VM whose daemons outlived it held the lock, so every
later run said "another autostart run holds the lock" and left. A limactl that
hung, or a usernet that daemonized, did the same. So every colima, docker and
osascript call, and restore.sh, closes descriptor 9 and runs under
`timeout -k 10 N`.

The start line is lifted out of the real script and run with the lock open
and a fake colima that reports whether it can see descriptor 9. The rule for
every other call is checked statically over the script text.
