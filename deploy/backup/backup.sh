# Daily encrypted Postgres dumps with retention. Runs as a long-lived compose
# service (see compose.example.yml); writes to /backups, which is bind-mounted
# to BACKUP_DIR on the host so the operator can rsync it off-box.
#
# With the argument `once` it runs one cycle and exits 0 on success, non-zero
# on failure (see the bottom). That is for the deployer's PRE_DEPLOY_HOOK:
#   docker compose -p <project> --project-directory <dir> run --rm -T backup once
# so the backup taken before a deploy gets the same encryption, naming and
# retention as the scheduled ones.
#
# pipefail is load-bearing: without it a failing pg_dump still exits 0 through
# gzip|openssl, the empty file gets promoted as a "successful" backup, and
# retention then ages the real history out night by night.
