# Nightly encrypted archive of the containers' logs, kept 420 days. Runs as a
# long-lived compose service (see compose.example.yml) beside backup.sh, from
# the same image, under the same passphrase and R2 bucket.
#
# Why: docker's json-file driver keeps at most five 10 MB files per container
# (compose.example.yml, x-log-bounds), which is days of history for a busy
# container, while incident regimes assume 180 days
# (CERT-In) to a year (DPDP). Each night this copies every log file the
# stack's containers wrote to in the last day, tars them (read in place, through
# a staging directory of symlinks) under the container's name, encrypts the
# archive exactly as backup.sh encrypts a dump, keeps it
# locally for LOG_ARCHIVE_KEEP_DAYS and PUTs a copy under logs/ in the R2
# bucket. A line that stays in the active file across several nights appears
# in several archives; that overlap is cheaper than tracking offsets. With the
# argument `once` it archives one time and exits (see the bottom).
#
# pipefail is load-bearing for the same reason as in backup.sh: without it a
# failing tar still exits 0 through gzip|openssl and an empty archive would be
# promoted as a good night.
