# Bring the product's VM back after a Mac restart - and, when the database
# volume is provably gone, restore it from the newest encrypted dump.
#
# Installed as a LaunchAgent (launchagent.plist.template, rendered by
# install-autostart.sh), so it
# runs at login with launchd's minimal environment and must assume nothing
# from the shell profile.
#
# The 2026-09-01 incident shaped every guard here. Two starters raced (a
# manual colima restart and a second boot), the VM came back on an empty data
# disk, and for half an hour "the data is gone" was indistinguishable from
# "the data is shadowed under a mount". Hence: a single-instance lock so this
# script never races ITSELF (a manual colima command takes no lock - the rule
# for humans stays: never cycle the VM while this agent is loaded); a
# data-disk verification so
# an unmounted datadisk (docker quietly running on the root disk) is treated
# as "do not touch, alert" rather than "empty, restore over it"; and the
# restore itself only fires when the disk is verified AND the volume is
# genuinely absent AND the dump is fresh.
#
# The restore path executes LIBRARY_DIR's restore.sh and COMPOSE_DIR's
# docker-compose.yml from the repo working tree at login. That is a
# deliberate, operator-accepted exception to the installed-copy rule the
# plist documents: unattended recovery cannot work from a frozen copy of a
# stack definition that deploys from git.
