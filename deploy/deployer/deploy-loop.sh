# Poll-based continuous deployment: GitHub main + green CI -> pull -> compose up.
#
# Runs as a compose service (profile "ops") with the VM's docker socket. It
# deploys from ITS OWN CLONE under $SRC_DIR — never from anyone's
# working tree — so what serves production is exactly what GitHub has and CI
# blessed. Secrets are not in git: the operator's env files are mounted
# read-only and copied into the clone at deploy time.
#
# The mount path $SRC_DIR is IDENTICAL inside this container and in
# the VM. That is load-bearing: compose resolves the stack's relative bind
# mounts against the compose file's path as this client sees it, and the
# daemon then opens that same path on the VM side.
#
# Known freeze modes (all fail-closed, all show as "waiting on CI" in logs):
# a commit whose message contains [skip ci] creates zero workflow runs and is
# never deployed; a cancelled or skipped run also blocks. Push a normal commit
# to unfreeze. (Workflow runs, from the Actions API - not check runs. The gate
# reads /actions/runs; calling them checks is what once sent a PAT scope
# comment wrong.)
#
# Every product-specific value comes from the environment, which the product's
# compose file supplies with `env_file: product.settings` (see product.settings.example
# beside this directory). A missing key stops the loop here, before it acts.
