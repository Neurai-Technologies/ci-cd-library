# Dependencies and licences

## Policy

- The lockfile is the inventory. Record here only what a lockfile cannot
  see: vendored assets (fonts, icons, colour profiles, images), binary SDKs
  (xcframeworks, AARs), and CC-BY provenance fields.
- Shipped code and anything bundled into a build may use only the allowed
  licences below. AGPL, GPL, LGPL, SSPL, BUSL, Fair Core, "source-available"
  and commercial-only code never enter shipped code and are never modified.
  Running such a tool unmodified as a separate process in CI is allowed when
  its licence permits it; record that use here.
- Compound SPDX expressions: `A OR B` passes when any option is allowed;
  `A AND B` requires every part to be allowed.
- THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md is generated at release by the stack's tool, with
  hand entries for vendored assets only. The licence gate runs in `just ci`
  once the stack is configured:
  - Node: `pnpm licenses list --prod --json` checked against the allowlist
  - Python: `pip-licenses --allow-only "<allowlist>"` inside the project venv
    (running it under a uv-managed venv is unverified)
  - Android: AboutLibraries Gradle plugin in strict mode
  - iOS and macOS: LicensePlist reading `Package.resolved` (SwiftPM has no
    first-party licence command)
  - Flutter: the built-in NOTICES asset and `showLicensePage()`
- Obligations beyond a notice: Apache-2.0 components' NOTICE files ship
  verbatim; OFL fonts keep their reserved font name and `OFL.txt`; vendored
  MPL-2.0 files are never edited (fork the file under its own licence if a
  change is needed); CC-BY assets carry author, title, source URL, licence
  and a note of modifications in the register.
- No runtime fetches from third-party CDNs. A dependency that defaults to a
  CDN is configured to bundle, and that setting is re-checked on upgrade.
- Commit the ecosystem's lockfile. Install with `--frozen-lockfile`,
  `npm ci`, `uv sync --locked` or the stack's equivalent. Never install
  during verification.
- Dependency-bot PRs are notifications: apply the bump locally, run `just ci`,
  commit through the normal path.
- Check transitive obligations when a direct dependency changes licence or
  brings in a copyleft transitive.

## Allowed licences (shipped code)

MIT, ISC, 0BSD, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, OFL-1.1,
CC0-1.0, CC-BY-4.0, Unlicense, BlueOak-1.0.0, Python-2.0, Zlib.

Add to this list only with a dated entry in DECISIONS.md. Do not copy another
project's exceptions.

## Register (vendored assets and binary SDKs only)

Nothing is vendored yet. The baseline uses Python 3.11+ standard-library
APIs, Git, Gitleaks and `just`; CI uses an immutable checkout-action pin and a
checksum-pinned Gitleaks binary, which are reproducibility choices reviewed
before updating.
